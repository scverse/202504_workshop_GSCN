# scverse workshop in collaboration with the GSCN

## Before the event

### Tech setup
In addition to the actual workshop, we offer two pre-workshop sessions designed to help participants with any issues installing software required for the workshop. During these, we also encourage participants to ask questions about basic Python/Jupyter Notebook usages (the notebook discussed in these sessions can be found [here](https://github.com/scverse/202504_workshop_GSCN/blob/main/misc/pre_workshop_session.ipynb)). The two sessions take place on:

- Wednesday (02.04.2025), 15:00 - 17:00 CET 
- Thursday (03.04.2025), 15:30 - 17:30 CET 

The Zoom links to these events can be found in the mail sent on Sunday, 30.03.2025.
